They have been separated from each other for 5 years, in order to cherish the opportunity

Still have to keep going. In this way, I can’t do it, and I don’t agree with it. One should realize the value and experience life as much as possible while living in the world , and “endure” the loss of life for the sake of static income. The loss is huge, and it is not a life of creation.

	•	People who don't like to express their opinions are always easy to be thought of as having no ideas or being smart, and some strong people like to express their opinions more, so they think that most other people are not as smart as themselves, especially those who like to express their opinions on whether others are smart or not .

	•	Don't be vague at all, vagueness represents fluke, self-deception, and self-feeling .
	•	Don't aim to read one book at a time, for example, the goal is to read 5 pages, the current power is 0.1>>0 @思思的陈涛 Regarding the problem of my inability to read books patiently: If there is an expert who listens carefully every time, I feel very rewarding after listening to it; while reading a book is a completely different mood . The books are overwhelming but I have never looked through them carefully. It is really impossible to read the books without borrowing them. You really should give yourself a plan, and look at every reading with the mood you look at appointments and lectures. 151. I don't know what other people's real feelings are when they read the book "Living Law". Sometimes I feel that the requirements in the book are too high and I don't want to think about it.
	•	"Very strange", "very weird" and "too strange", these thoughts show that I still don't understand, and I often want to attribute the reason to "weird" to release . There is nothing too strange, and you can often find it if you look carefully for the way to learn.

	•	I recently re-read Kazuo Inamori's "How to Live", which mentioned concentration and devotion, and the example of improvement in ceramic technology was particularly impressive to me. When we do everything ( write a program, write an email, write a plan ) , do we think whether we have devoted ourselves to doing it seriously, and the result is really different? Try it: How focused can you be?
	•	I posted it for myself Entrepreneurship, technology, management, innovation, introspection labels.

【About Management】
	•	Looking around the thatched cottage is no longer applicable, you have to look around
	•	My own approach: Forget about qualifications and focus on evaluating abilities and potential. Seniority is an anchor, but not necessarily accurate.
	•	A colleague mentioned recruiting more girls to enliven the atmosphere. I was dizzy. Sure enough, it was a young and young idea. I thought about it over the weekend, and it should be that I can actually see the improvement of the product , the improvement of the user experience, the improvement of my own practice, the wisdom and sparks in the communication, and the improvement of personal satisfaction, which is the key to high .
	•	Don't pretend, be honest and real. The team is full of honest and real people, and the cost of communication will be much lower.
	•	Candid communication is the main problem of company team management
	•	For entrepreneurs, finding the right person is often an excuse for inaction, the truth is the right person

It will never exist, let yourself become the most suitable person. Entrepreneurs will always exist as half of HR .

	•	He answered the key points for dealing with some people in the team who cannot keep up with the company's development. Three principles: 1. Focus on morality , and leave if there are major problems with morality. 2. Speak clearly and unambiguously. Team surprises, guesses, worries. 3. In the case of virtue, lack of talent or mismatch, parachutes should be given to the person who descends. The parachute must have gold content, and it must be considered for others
	•	When you give a person enough trust and pressure, he can always do better than before.
	•	During a meeting, there are always busy people answering emails and playing text messages, thinking that the other people ’s affairs discussed have nothing to do with themselves, which is extremely wrong. Asking you to participate in the meeting shows that the leader thinks that you need to know the content of the meeting and wants to hear your opinion. If you find that you can't listen and don't contribute to the meeting, you will not be asked to participate in the meeting. Over time, in the organization It is also marginalized.
	•	A fair culture and fair trust are very important, and rewards and punishments are clearly defined, so that everyone believes that the rules of the game exist, will challenge themselves for greater rewards, and will not have a fluke mentality. CEOs need to keep in mind principles like these .
	•	For the organization, it is necessary to clearly convey the excellent standards and keep improving. Ambiguity and confusion are sacrifices.
	•	Joining us does not represent the current job. In case I say in case, this vote is unsuccessful, join us, and you will find that there are still many things worth doing in the world. Just to see if you have enough vision and passion.

	•	Perhaps the hardest thing for a CEO is resisting the urge to solve problems on his own. You have been in a lot of battles, and you are probably the most experienced and qualified to solve problems. But that doesn't make it possible to build a good management team. Leaving someone else the opportunity and expecting them to fix the problem is tough, but worth it. In this way, the ability of the entire team can be improved.
	•	I often see people with pretty positions, but when I look closely, I find that every time he gets promoted, it happens when he changes jobs . This will make me vigilant, because the boss will raise the salary and promote the good people to keep them. If a person is promoted multiple times in the same company, it makes me feel a lot more at ease, because people who know him better than me value him and give him more responsibility, and he is competent again and again. Getting promoted only after changing jobs may be a result of being strong outside and doing well in the middle, fooling the new boss.
	•	Amazon started off selling books, and now it is very profitable without selling books. 360 started out doing search, and now it is very powerful without search . Some companies, such as Xunlei, started from p2sp and client-side, but have not continued to expand and innovate in this field. That's the team difference.
	•	A boss with a net worth of more than 20 billion does not show off, climb mountains, brag, squabble, accept interviews, or appear on TV magazines. He sets an example by testing products down-to-earth like a grassroots employee every day, and improves the product experience endlessly. . This is the biggest reason for Tencent's success. The Losers who were defeated by Tencent have never realized this, either scolding it for plagiarism, or saying that it relies on QQ to succeed.
	•	Entrepreneurship is becoming more and more popular in China, and outstanding talents will also be among them. Moreover, a good mechanism is also an important competitiveness. I suggest that all entrepreneurs share the entrepreneurial process and results with a good mentality, mechanism and team instead of "fooling", so that it will be easier for startups to attract talents.
	•	Complete the preparations for option distribution today, and distribute them to the first batch of outstanding members next week. start to formulate

When issuing the plan, I had some disagreements with other directors: I emphasized that I wanted to issue options at a very low strike price , while other directors emphasized accounting evaluation issues. I finally adopted my plan, because I know the mentality of the entrepreneurial team members very well. The mentality and state of an early company member are the most fundamental, and other problems are just "technical problems".

Always losing the chain at work and needing to be reminded is constantly losing your reputation. We are what we repeatedly do , not we repeatedly think or want or say.
	•	There is no such thing as a free lunch. If a startup company wants to get ahead, it requires very good and high self-requirements. Say goodbye to "almost", "it's okay", "let's do it first", say goodbye to lost work, procrastination,
80 points. Many start-up companies are not as good as big companies, and they are immersed in the state of "entrepreneurship", or they are only immersed in the state of "entrepreneurship" with long working hours.

	•	What is a company's worst enemy? "Frankly," Welch said. Deeply agree. Fortunately, candor can be cultivated.
	•	I think that in the future, the work of the team, no matter how big or small, should define and decompose the goals of the work, and post

sent out. 1. In this way, others can give their opinions; 2. It can avoid duplication of work; 3. Avoid errors in clear definition and understanding; 4. At the same time, it can estimate the workload and evaluate the efficiency method. Clear and unambiguous to become the company's culture.
	•	[Workplace] Last night, please play more outstanding employees for dinner, and chatted about some workplace experiences. ( 1 ) Treat yourself as a boss, work hard like a boss, and your ability will naturally improve. With the ability, if playing more can’t give you a good return, other companies will definitely give you. ( 2 ) Not every time you pay, you will be rewarded, but if you continue to pay, you will definitely be rewarded. @李学琳 added one more point: Think like your boss , and your ability will improve faster.
	•	Someone asked me how to break through my career bottleneck, I said: Your bottleneck lies in your heart. Your heart is wider and your mentality is better. When encountering problems, turn yourself to a higher level to look at the problem, and break all the little entanglements, doubts, calculations, and selfishness in your heart , and you will have no bottlenecks.
	•	Recently, everyone reviewed the progress of Jiujiufang for half a year and discussed everyone's summary and assumptions, and their confidence in us has increased. Discussed with colleagues: Entrepreneurship requires frequent introspection, avoiding self-strengthening and hypnosis. So we need to distinguish between confidence and " YY". True confidence comes from seeing one's own progress and potential, which can be divided into two aspects: 1. Confidence in judging things themselves 2. Confidence in yourself and the team. 30. At one o'clock in the morning on Saturday, I received a text message from an entrepreneur: The conclusion of everyone's discussion is to drive yourself crazy and drive others to death! At that time, they were working hard all night for their dreams. The ultimate in my understanding is to make things beyond one's own ability. Only extreme things can surpass the imagination of users and have a good reputation.
	•	It is one of the characteristics of a good team to be able to self-demand and challenge each other in the subtleties . For example, the usual time allocation, working status, thinking training, communication and expression, and small habits.
	•	The easiest way to recruit people is to recruit people who have done this job . However, the most suitable trait can be found

people are more important. Especially for innovative companies, many positions may not be filled with mature people, or the industry 's general standards are not particularly suitable, or specific positions have some special requirements. At this time, it is particularly important to recruit people with personality, skills and hobbies through an understanding of the position.
	•	In fact, joining a good early-stage company has an obvious advantage: the company will try its best to help you improve, because the company has a lot to do, and the staff is limited. At this time, various high requirements will be put forward for those with potential to help them improve. In a big company, even if your boss is willing ( not necessarily ) to spend time and energy coaching you, there are definitely not as many start-up companies.
	•	After interviewing more than a dozen people this week, I finally decided on an intern. More than 50 people may have been interviewed in the past month or so , and there are only 2 very interested candidates in total, one of which failed and the other is still negotiating. Whenever I want to lower my requirements, I remind myself that I must not go low but go high. We have to do well, not finish things. Especially in the early days, the ability, quality and attitude of the core people are the most critical.
	•	A good team should be able to continuously innovate and break through.
	•	have 2 friends 2 years ago I admire the start of a business with 100,000 yuan, and I met an entrepreneur today
3 years ago 0 yuan Starting a business surprised me.
	•	The company's incentive system and assessment system are very important. I don't know if what I'm looking at is a special case. I know that managers in important positions in many companies have been receiving good returns for a long time, while focusing on tossing things they think about. Be sure to avoid this. ( No one thinks that this situation is reasonable )
	•	I didn’t feel that self-confidence was very important when interviewing and selecting people before. Now I find that self-confidence is not an important characteristic in general simple things and work, but for some key things and responsibilities, self-confidence is an important difference. It is really difficult or challenging. things are often reversed

or relatively lonely.
	•	Noon Brother Liang said that in the early days of a start-up company, they had to work hard and interview more people to find talents. Pharaoh said that his first position is hr . I think they are right.
	•	It's been about half a year since it went online, and I often feel that the progress is too slow. Speed, quality, and cost cannot all be achieved at the same time. Of course, the speed of team growth is also an important factor.
	•	I reviewed the opinions and suggestions on me and the company obtained from each 1:1 communication with different team members in the past six months , and divided them into resolved, partially resolved, and problems that remain. Well, the improvements are not good enough.
	•	Marriage takes a long process of falling in love to get a certificate, and the time to find a business partner is very short. If marriage is 60 years of cooperation, and entrepreneurship is six or seven years of cooperation, should we spend 1/10 of the time talking about "love"?
	•	Long-term returns focus on share options. However, this aspect is not yet standardized in China: even the early core Members are not informed of the proportion of their options to the company's total share capital, and concepts such as priority repayment, exercise price, and exercise conditions are not popularized. Therefore, many company boards make the total number of shares very large, allowing employees to Work sounds nice. I don't think it's going to last, we're not going to do that.
	•	How to attract talents: I summarize (the summary does not mean that I have done a good job, but realize that I have to do a good job) four elements: [short-term return], [long-term return], [personal growth], [spiritual life]. From left to right, from easy to difficult, the rich and unusual life experience and spiritual life are the most comprehensive and demanding . We must constantly reflect on the pursuit, and Jiujiufang will work hard to do it well! Excellent technical talents and product talents are welcome to join and work together.
	•	Some people can be motivated by the pursuit of excellence, others by realistic rewards, but the two approaches can be linked. I relate like this: "As long as I can improve patience does not

If there are enough shortcomings, it is equivalent to a 30 % increase in personal value." 03

	•	There is no sense of security in piled up products, only accurate choices can be made.

	•	Paying attention to service and experience is an important opportunity. With the increase of income level, we are afraid of trouble and hope that high-quality service will become the driving force for payment. Helping users save money is no longer the only idea, or even the best idea.
Very strong technical application to improve the experience, relying on the strong driving force of technology to make the impossible possible. 6. Common questions for product managers: What are the benefits, is it important, how do you know, is there a good way to achieve this benefit
	•	If you are very talented and skilled in some areas, please don't rush to show your edge. If you are only in the new unit as an ordinary person rather than a leader, then you should not show your edge too much. When a person is new to a unit, it is like throwing a stone into a calm pool of water. It often attracts attention, and every move, word and deed is in the eyes of others.

	•	In the future, there will be more innovations in input and output to make information flow, and more mechanisms for distributing recommendations will be rotated
	•	I have met 2 big fools since I was a child (not the kind of people who are fooled by something, but the kind of people who are foolish), one is a middle school classmate, and the other is this year. My conclusion is that you must not associate with big fools, otherwise If the interests are not damaged, the reputation will also be damaged. Don't even try to be perfunctory, it will also waste your time.
	•	Lin Biao studied strategy more than tactics. When the Communist Army first arrived in the Northeast in 1946 , a division could not defeat a regiment of the National Army . He risked his life to go to the battlefield to watch the battle, and studied the squad's three-three battle formation, one point and two sides and other tactical methods. And personally lectured and promoted it, narrowing the gap in combat effectiveness with the national army. Without Lin Biao, the Communist Party would probably lose the Northeast and change the course of the war. For an enterprise, if there are too many strategists, it is not a good thing. The more people who grasp the details, the better.

	•	Today, a colleague of the company said after using G2 for a week: Although I still don’t know how to use many functions, I think everyone will use smartphones in 5 years, and I am very happy to use them now. Similar words were heard again in the company, this time it was predicted by a colleague with a non- IT background. Using a smart phone is a change in the attitude and way of life, and trying a new life itself is a positive attitude, and positive attitudes can be mutually infective.
	•	Repeatedly experience the need to experience the product repeatedly, and use the product intensively
	•	Irrationality allows various business opportunities to exist in society, and irrationality allows startups to miss these opportunities. Don't be irrational, be very rational.
	•	The Internet industry tends to be WinnerTakesAll , and even in traditional industries, people who work 120% get 200 % return. This can be beneficial to the society, and the society needs to encourage top , extreme, and innovation to drive social development. So before going out every day, ask yourself how you can go all out to be outstanding.
	•	Strategy is very important, but the team is also very important, I have personal experience. The competition between Kuxun and Qunar has a clear direction, but the gap is getting bigger and bigger. At that time, we competed with Kaixin in China and knew Kaixin’s data products very well. Unfortunately, we just watched the opponent’s success from product to promotion . Going back to the current group buying website, the model is very simple and there is no threshold, but it can also open up this

What a big gap.

	•	Just finished user usability testing and found many problems. Usability testing is to allow the team to observe the user experience closely and objectively, and discover problems that the team took for granted during work or ignored because of familiarity. I always remind myself to avoid wishful thinking and self-strengthening in the process of starting a business .
	•	Common problems of start-up companies: technology blames product, product blames strategy, strategy blames market. But often this kind of company's technical products, products, and products are not doing very well.
